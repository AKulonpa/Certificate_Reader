This program is supposed to go through the input file (job certificates of experience) and transform it to a specific type, send the file contents to an AI service for analysis, get the answer from the AI service, evaluate and save the data that is required to make a decision about the internship.
The data the program needs to get from the input file : determine the workers job duties, the company they worked at, when the work took place and how many ECTS credits the worker is eligible based on the the work certificate. 
The program should be able to transfer .pdf .txt .docx and .jpg files to a single file type to make the processing easier.
The AI service should analyze the text in the file and give back description of the following: job duties, company, timeline of work and ECTS credits based on the time.
