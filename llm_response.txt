     - 16 years = 16 * 52 weeks = 832 weeks
     - 5 months = Approximately 4 months (considering end of May)
     - 4 months = Approximately 17 weeks
     - Total = 832 + 17 = 849 weeks.
   - Assuming 38 hours per week:
     - Total hours worked = 849 weeks * 38 hours/week = 32,262 hours.
   - Total ECT credits = Total hours / 27 hours = 32,262 / 27 ≈ 1196.4 ECT credits.
